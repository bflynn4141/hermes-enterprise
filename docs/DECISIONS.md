# Decisions

Choices made while building M1 where the production plan was silent, plus the
places where reality differed from what the plan assumed. Each one says what was
decided, why, and what would change it.

---

## 1. Migrations are hand-written SQL; Drizzle is the typed view

**Decided.** `apps/worker/migrations/*.sql` is the source of truth. The Drizzle
schema in `src/db/schema.ts` mirrors it, and a test compares the two table by
table and column by column. `drizzle-kit` is not installed.

**Why.** The schema's substance is row-level security, forced policies, partial
unique indexes, triggers, a grant matrix and an expand/contract discipline. None
of that survives a round trip through a schema generator, so a generated
migration would be a migration whose most important half was written by hand
anyway. Keeping the SQL primary means the reviewable artefact is the one that
runs. The cost is drift, and the drift test is the answer to that.

**Would change it if.** Drizzle gains first-class RLS, policy and grant
expression, and the generated SQL becomes reviewable.

---

## 2. Migrations prove their own idempotence on every run

**Decided.** `pnpm db:migrate` applies everything pending, fingerprints the
schema (columns, constraints, indexes, policies, RLS flags, triggers, grants,
views), re-applies every migration from the beginning, fingerprints again, and
fails if the two differ.

**Why.** A half-applied deploy has to be recoverable by running the runner
again. "These statements are idempotent" is easy to believe and easy to get
wrong — one `CREATE INDEX` without `IF NOT EXISTS` is enough. This turns the
claim into a check that runs every time rather than a test someone remembers to
write.

**Note.** Editing a migration that has already been applied is refused, because
staging and production would then disagree about what `0002` is. While iterating
against a throwaway database, `MIGRATE_ALLOW_EDIT=1` lifts that.

---

## 3. Roles are created by a script, not by a migration

**Decided.** `apps/worker/scripts/roles.mjs` creates `owner`, `app` and `agent`
and hands the schema to `owner`. `pnpm db:migrate` runs it first.

**Why.** Roles are cluster objects, not schema objects, and migrations run *as*
`owner`, which does not exist the first time. In staging and production the same
three roles are created once by whoever provisions the Neon project.

The script also sets `NOBYPASSRLS NOSUPERUSER` on all three, including `owner`.
A role that can bypass row-level security would quietly undo `FORCE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY`; a test asserts none of the three can.

---

## 4. `rate_counters` is the one tenant-shaped table outside RLS

**Decided.** It carries `workspace_id` but has no policy, and
`hermes_tenant_tables()` excludes it by name.

**Why.** A per-user limit that can be evaded by failing to set the tenant key is
not a limit. The counter is keyed by user first, so a user cannot spread a burst
across workspaces either. Every other table with a `workspace_id` is covered
automatically: the RLS migration ends by raising if any tenant table lacks
forced RLS, so a new table fails the migration rather than leaking.

---

## 5. `workspaces` is filtered on `id`, not `workspace_id`

**Decided.** Its policy is `id = app_workspace_id()`; every other tenant table
uses `workspace_id = app_workspace_id()`. Both spellings come from one helper
function, and a test asserts each table has exactly one policy with exactly the
expected predicate.

---

## 6. Removal is a status change; `app` holds no DELETE on `members`

**Decided.** The `app` role may INSERT and UPDATE `members` but not DELETE.
Removing someone sets `status = 'inactive'`. The last-Admin trigger still covers
DELETE, for the owner-level paths (a migration, a WorkOS reconciliation).

**Why.** History has to keep rendering after a removal, and a deleted row takes
its own audit trail with it. The same reasoning removed DELETE from `requests`,
`documents`, `effects`, `runs`, `events` and `stream_events`. Erasure goes
through `redact_subject`, which rewrites subject text and leaves the ids.

---

## 7. Job keys must contain an id; `UNIQUE(kind, key)` is global

**Found while testing.** The uniqueness is not per workspace. A key like
`receipt:latest` would let one workspace's enqueue silently suppress another's,
and the suppressed tenant could not even see the row that blocked it, because
RLS hides it. Every key the product writes therefore contains a uuid, the
docstring on `enqueueJob` says so, and a test pins the collision down so the
behaviour is documented rather than discovered.

---

## 8. Three Vitest projects, two runtimes

**Decided.** `unit` and `db` run in Node; `worker` runs inside workerd through
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, reading the same `wrangler.jsonc` a deploy
reads.

**Why the split.** The pool installed cleanly, and the workerd project earns its
place: it proves the Worker boots with the real bindings, that `/health` reaches
a Durable Object, and that the routes behave in the real runtime.

What it cannot do is reach Postgres. `node-postgres` is CommonJS and requires
`node:net` and `node:dns`; Vitest's module runner cannot hand those to workerd
(`deps.optimizer` fails to resolve the builtins, and `server.deps.inline` fails
on the CommonJS entry). The deployed bundle is fine — esbuild resolves it, and
`wrangler dev --local` serves `/health` against Docker Postgres through both
Hyperdrive bindings — so this is a test-harness limitation, not a runtime one.
So the tests that need a database (row-level security, the grant matrix, the
triggers, the jobs claim, the routes end to end) run in Node against the same
Docker Postgres, with the identical Hono app and an `Env` whose Hyperdrive
bindings carry the same connection strings.

Two consequences, both deliberate:

* `src/db/client.ts` imports `pg` lazily, so the Worker's module graph can be
  loaded by tooling that cannot transform a CommonJS dependency.
* The Node projects alias `cloudflare:workers` and `cloudflare:workflows` to
  stubs in `test/stubs/`. Nothing is tested through those stubs; the classes
  that use the real modules are covered by the workerd project.

**Would change it if.** The pool gains a way to bundle a CommonJS dependency
with node builtins, or we move to a Postgres driver that is ESM and uses
`connect()` from `cloudflare:sockets`.

---

## 9. `compatibility_date` is pinned to the test runtime's ceiling

**Decided.** `2026-08-22`, the newest date the workerd binary bundled with
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` accepts.

**Why.** A later date makes the Worker unstartable in tests. A Worker we cannot
run in workerd is a Worker we cannot test in workerd, which is worth more than
three weeks of compatibility flags. Raise both together when the pool updates.

---

## 10. Durable Objects use `exports`, not `migrations`

**Decided.** `wrangler.jsonc` declares both hub classes in the `exports` map,
per environment, with `storage: "sqlite"`. The `migrations` array is absent; the
two are mutually exclusive.

**Why.** The plan requires `exports`. Its consequences are accepted: gradual
deployments are not supported with it, and removing a class name deletes that
namespace and all of its stored data permanently. Both hubs hold no truth, so
the second consequence costs one reconnect — but a rename is still a `renamed`
tombstone, never an edit. A unit test asserts the top level and both
environments declare the same classes.

---

## 11. Hyperdrive local connection strings live in `.env`, not `.dev.vars`

**Found while running.** `.dev.vars` carries Worker secrets, which the Worker
reads at runtime. Wrangler resolves
`CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING>` from its own process
environment while it parses `wrangler.jsonc`, before the Worker exists. So there
are two example files: `.env.example` for those two, `.dev.vars.example` for
every secret. Both are gitignored in their real form.

The alternative, `localConnectionString` inside `wrangler.jsonc`, was rejected:
it puts a credential in a committed file, and a unit test now asserts that
string never appears there.

---

## 12. `/health` reads `catalog`, not `schema_migrations`

**Decided.** Both roles can read `catalog`, so one query proves both
connections. `schema_migrations` is readable by `app` only.

**Why.** The alternative was granting the `agent` role SELECT on
`schema_migrations` for the sake of a health check. Widening the agent role's
grants to make a status page prettier is exactly the trade this product should
not make.

---

## 13. Money is stored in minor units

**Decided.** `amount_minor` and `total_minor` are integers; the invoice schema
refuses a total that does not equal the sum of its lines, and a due date before
the issue date.

**Why.** An approval is of exact content. Floating-point dollars make 1200.00
and 1199.999999 the same approval, and a total that disagrees with its lines is
a document the reviewer cannot check by reading it.

---

## 14. `chat/send` was renamed `chat/prompt`

**Found while testing.** The forbidden-name test — which refuses any model
command or tool named after a human action — flagged `chat/send`. The command
only puts text in the composer, but a registry entry with `send` in its name is
exactly the thing that rule exists to catch, and arguing with the rule is how
the rule stops working. Renamed.

---

## 15. Catalog rows, and why two are disabled

**Decided.** Four rows, seeded by migration `0007`. `deepseek-flash` and
`claude-sonnet-4-6` are enabled; `claude-opus-4-7` is disabled because the cost
per screening run is an order of magnitude above Sonnet and the pilot has a $50
spend alarm; `gpt-5-5` is disabled until the M3 reasoning-replay engine test for
the Responses transport passes. The demo's Nous Portal row is not carried: it
was a proposed demo configuration, never a verified deployment.

A row is offered to a workspace only when `disabled_reason IS NULL` **and** that
workspace holds a verified key for the row's provider. In M1 no workspace holds
a key, so `bootstrap` returns four rows, all `enabled: false` — which is what
makes "Add a provider key in Settings to start" an empty state rather than an
error.

Prices are the figures the production plan recorded on 2026-09-14 and carry
`pricing_verified_on`. They are treated as illustrative until re-verified
against each vendor's own pricing page; the Usage screen says "estimated, billed
by your provider". A price change is a new migration.

---

## 16. The event contract's stream ids are strings

**Decided.** `stream_events.id` is a bigserial; the contract carries it as a
decimal string and the run-log validator compares ids as `BigInt`.

**Why.** JSON numbers lose integers past 2^53. A replay cursor that silently
rounds is a client that silently skips events. A test compares ids either side
of 2^53 to keep that honest.

---

## 17. A replay row that no longer parses triggers `resync`

**Decided.** `GET /w/:ws/events` parses every row against the contract. A row
that fails sets `resync: true` and the page returns no events.

**Why.** The alternative is dropping the row, which leaves a hole in a
transcript the reader has no way to notice. Telling the client to refetch is
cheap and honest.

---

## 18. A non-member gets 404, not 403

**Decided.** `TenancyError('not_a_member')` maps to 404.

**Why.** Whether a workspace exists is itself information a non-member should
not have. The membership lookup runs *inside* the tenant transaction, under the
policy it is checking, so there is no window in which a query runs with the
wrong tenant key.

---

## 19. The fake auth adapter refuses unknown users

**Decided.** `AUTH_MODE=fake` looks the `x-dev-user` value up in `users` by id
or email and returns 401 `unknown_user` if there is no row. `AUTH_MODE=workos`
returns 503 `not_configured` until M2 rather than falling back.

**Why.** The worst possible failure mode is a production Worker trusting a
header because its auth mode was misconfigured. A unit test asserts both
deployed environments set `AUTH_MODE=workos`.

---

## 20. What M1 deliberately does not have

No decision route (M4), no run engine (M3), no WebSocket upgrade route (M2, the
hubs exist and are tested through `/health`), no provider-key routes (M2), no
`POST /workspaces` (M2), no Sentry wiring (the DSN is named in
`.dev.vars.example`; the client is added with the auth middleware in M2), no
`@react-pdf/renderer` or pdfjs spike (M1's remaining half-day; both are recorded
as **unverified** in the plan and neither blocks the rails).
